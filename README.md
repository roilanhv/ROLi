# Introduction

The incident longwave radiation (Li) is one of the essential components in
the surface energy balance. It influences the balance of radiation, which determines the energy
available to sensible and latent heat fluxes in surface. The Li can be determined with good
accuracy from the moisture vertical profile, air temperature and other gases  
(CO_2, CH_4, N_2O) concentration
in the atmosphere. But these data are not always available and therefore simpler methods
have been developed based on more readily available measures, such as the temperature and
humidity measured in meteorological stations. Several empirical expressions to estimate the
emissivity of the atmosphere in clear sky conditions (e\_{ac}) and cloud cover fraction (C) are
available in the literature. However, when applied to regions different from those in which they were obtained, the uncertainty in the estimation increases.
